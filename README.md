# TRAFFIC-LIGHT
 This Arduino-based project simulates a simple traffic light system with red, yellow, and green LEDs. The traffic light cycles through each color with specified delays, including a blinking yellow light. It demonstrates basic Arduino programming and control of digital pins to simulate a real-world traffic light.
